# AGPM - There is no such object on the server

Just recently encountered an issue with AGPM. In this case it was regarding the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in. But This might show up in other cases as well.

The error message when editing the GPO via AGPM change control.
```
An error occurred while trying to open the policy.
Error: There is no such object on the server
Code: 0x2030
```

The fix in our case was the following:

The AGPM server needs line of sight and be connected to the PDC.
This was made possible by creating a subnet in Active Directory Sites and Services, assigning this subnet to the site which holds the PDC and rebooting the AGPM server. Note that there needs to be connectivity between the AGPM and the PDC for this to work.

Verify on the AGPM server with the following:
```
NLtest /DSGetDC:Domain_DNS
```
for example
```
NLtest /DSGetDC:contoso.com
```

After that the snap-in worked as expected.
