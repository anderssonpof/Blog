# Running AGPM with a Managed Service Account 

Running AGPM service using a managed service account instead of a regular user.
To my knowledge it is not officially supported but certainly possible.

I will assume that you have an managed service account and a temporary service account user and password to use for the installation.

- Assign both the MSA and the service account user logon as service on the AGPM Server
- Install AGPM using the service account user
- Transfer the SPN of the service account user to the MSA
    - Get the SPN: `setspn -l <user>`
    - Delete the SPN `setspn -D AgpmServer/<server dns name>/<domain dns name> <user>`
    - Add the SPN `setspn -A AgpmServer/<server dns name>/<domain dns name> <msa>`
- Make sure that the MSA has full access to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\AGPM` and `%windir%\temp`
- Give the required access to the MSA
    - GPOs
    - Roo of each domain
    - Group Policy Creator Owners
    - Backup Operators
    - Any other permissions that's required for AGPM to work in your environment
- Change the AGPM service to use the MSA (leave the password blank)
- Remove the temporary service account user
- Remove logon as a service for the service account user
